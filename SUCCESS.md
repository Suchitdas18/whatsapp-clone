## 📝 Final Checklist

1.  **Backend Restarted?**
    Make sure you stopped and restarted the backend server (`npm run dev`) after my last fix. This is **critical** to stop the login loop.

2.  **Login Test:**
    - Go to **http://localhost:3000**
    - Login or Sign Up.
    - You should land on the Chat Dashboard and **stay there**.

3.  **Chat Test:**
    - Try creating a new chat (click the `+` button).
    - Send a message.
    - It should appear instantly!

## 🐞 Still Looping?
If you *still* get logged out after 1 second:
1.  **Clear Browser Data:** Right-click -> Inspect -> Application -> Local Storage -> Right-click `http://localhost:3000` -> Clear.
2.  **Restart Backend Again:** Just to be absolutely sure.

**You have successfully built and fixed the WhatsApp Clone!** 🎉
